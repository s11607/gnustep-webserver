2009-12-09 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServer.m: Workaround for denial of service issues with HTTPS.
	An attacker could connect in and stop responding during the SSL
	handshake.  Because the handshake in gnustep-base has a 30 second
	timeout, this could have two nasty conserquences.
	Firstly the minor issue, if the connection idle timer was short
	enough (and the default is 30 seconds) the connection could time
	out before the handshaker completes.
	The major issue is that the code was not starting a new background
	accept until after the ssl handshake ... so the server would not
	be able to handle any new connections while the handshake was
	taking place.
	The solution is simply to schedule the next accept before performing
	the handshake for the current connection.
